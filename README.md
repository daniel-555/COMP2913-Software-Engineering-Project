# Project dependencies

Before you can work on the project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- NodeJS



# Running the Project Locally

The frontend and backend are separate servers so each must be ran individually. Go into each corresponding directory in a separate terminal window and execute the command `npm start` in each.
**note - although the presentation and application layers are both ran locally, the database is hosted online with MongoDB**
