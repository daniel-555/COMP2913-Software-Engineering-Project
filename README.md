# Project dependencies

After you have cloned the repo and before you can work on the project, make sure you have:
1. installed NodeJS (https://www.nodejs.org) on your machine
2. added the supplied `.env` file into the `backend/` directory
3. ran `npm install` in both the `frontend/` and `backend/` to install the project dependencies

# Running the Project Locally

The frontend and backend are separate servers so each must be ran individually. Go into each corresponding directory in a separate terminal window and execute the command `npm start` in each.

**note - although the presentation and application layers are both ran locally, the database is hosted online with MongoDB so can be edited by all devs.**
